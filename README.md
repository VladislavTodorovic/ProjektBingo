This project was an assignment after the Java section (before learning object-oriented programming) in the IT Bootcamp course "Software Testing (QA)" organized by "Fondacija Ana i Vlade Divac", which I completed in June 2024.

Project - BINGO!
Create a Bingo project. Within this project, we will have one class with the following methods:
a) izgenerisi() - this method should generate and return an array of 30 random numbers from 1 to 50.
b) unesiSvoje() - within this method, you should enter your 6 numbers for guessing (you can generate them using Random or input them via Scanner).
c) izvlacenje(int[] prviNiz, int[] drugiNiz) - you will input two previously generated arrays, and it will print a message indicating how many numbers were matched in total.
In the main method of the class, only call these three methods.
